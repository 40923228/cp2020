<h2>PCH6-RAM Basics</h2>
<p><span>In order for a computer to function, it needs a temporary storage space to store data that is input into the computer from the user or the hard drive, and to store data that is about to be written to more permanent storage. This temporary storage is called RAM, or random access memory. RAM is the workspace for the CPU to process data. When the computer boots up the OS (operating system) loads the start files into RAM. RAM is dynamic and constantly changing. It operates much faster than a hard drive, and can be changed at any time by the computer. RAM is volatile memory which means it loses all its information when power is removed, so it can only be used as temporary storage. This memory is used for operating systems startup files (bootstrap loader), programs, data, and disk caching. Adding RAM to a computer is one of the easiest and most effective upgrades a person can perform, since it drastically improves the transfers between the CPU and the other input devices (like hard drives), and this increases the overall speed of the computer.</span></p>
