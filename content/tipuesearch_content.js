This temporary storage is called RAM, or random access memory. RAM is the workspace for the CPU to process data. When the computer boots up the OS (operating system) loads the start files into RAM. RAM is dynamic and constantly changing. It operates much faster than a hard drive, and can be changed at any time by the computer. RAM is volatile memory which means it loses all its information when power is removed, so it can only be used as temporary storage. This memory is used for operating systems startup files (bootstrap loader), programs, data, and disk caching. Adding RAM to a computer is one of the easiest and most effective upgrades a person can perform, since it drastically improves the transfers between the CPU and the other input devices (like hard drives), and this increases the overall speed of the computer. \n 為了使計算機正常運行，它需要一個臨時存儲空間來存儲從用戶或硬盤驅動器輸入到計算機中的數據，並將要寫入的數據存儲到更永久的存儲器中。該臨時存儲稱為RAM或隨機存取存儲器。 RAM是CPU處理數據的工作區。計算機啟動時，操作系統（操作系統）將啟動文件加載到RAM中。 RAM是動態的並且不斷變化。它的運行速度比硬盤驅動器快得多，並且可由計算機隨時更改。 RAM是易失性內存，這意味著在斷電時它會丟失所有信息，因此只能用作臨時存儲。該內存用於操作系統啟動文件（引導加載程序），程序，數據和磁盤緩存。向計算機添加RAM是一個人可以執行的最簡單，最有效的升級之一，因為它可以極大地改善CPU與其他輸入設備（如硬盤驅動器）之間的傳輸，從而提高了計算機的整體速度。 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH6-RAM Basics.html'}, {'title': 'Memory Modules', 'text': 'One of the uses of memory is to serve as a disk cache. Like the caches we mentioned in the processor, the RAM acts as a faster, temporary storage area for recently used and commonly used data from the hard drive. Because it is quicker to access RAM than to seek out the data in the hard drive’s sectors, RAM increases the performance of the machine. Disk caching can be used only when there is available extra space in the memory. But what happens if you do not have enough physical memory available? When there is not enough physical memory, the computer creates virtual memory. Virtual memory is sometimes referred to as "page files" or “swap files.” Virtual memory is a slow substitute for RAM since it is a temporary file created on the hard drive and emulates the physical RAM. Essentially, disk caching allows RAM to act like an extremely fast hard drive, while virtual memory consists of files on the hard drive acting as extremely slow memory. RAM is faster than either magnetic storage (like hard drives and floppy disks) or optical storage (DVD, CD, Blu-ray). This is because RAM is a solid-state device without exceedingly long access times. RAM operates in the billionths of a second (nanoseconds), while hard drives and other magnetic media are very slow, operating in the thousandths of a second (milliseconds). Insufficient RAM causes a computer to operate more slowly. So, upgrading RAM is one of the most common upgrades performed by an A+ technician. \n 內存的用途之一是充當磁盤緩存。就像我們在處理器中提到的緩存一樣，RAM充當了硬盤驅動器中最近使用和常用數據的更快的臨時存儲區域。由於訪問RAM比查找硬盤驅動器扇區中的數據更快，因此RAM可提高計算機的性能。僅當內存中有可用空間時才可以使用磁盤緩存。但是，如果您沒有足夠的物理內存可用怎麼辦？當物理內存不足時，計算機將創建虛擬內存。虛擬內存有時也稱為“頁面文件”或“交換文件”。虛擬內存是RAM的慢速替代品，因為它是在硬盤驅動器上創建的臨時文件，並模擬物理RAM。本質上，磁盤緩存使RAM可以充當極快的硬盤驅動器，而虛擬內存由硬盤驅動器上的文件組成，它們的運行速度非常慢。 RAM比磁性存儲（如硬盤驅動器和軟盤）或光學存儲（DVD，CD，藍光）快。這是因為RAM是固態設備，訪問時間沒有特別長。 RAM的運行速度為十億分之一秒（十億分之一秒），而硬盤驅動器和其他磁性介質的運行速度非常慢，其運行速度為千分之一秒（毫秒）。 RAM不足會導致計算機運行更慢。因此，升級RAM是A +技術人員執行的最常見的升級之一。 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Memory Modules.html'}, {'title': 'Classifying Memory', 'text': 'There are multiple classifications for RAM: memory module type, chip type, speed, and parity. Memory modules vary by type, which is defined by the motherboard and the motherboard’s form factor. Memory modules are defined by the number of pins they have on the modules, like 240-pin DIMM (dual in-line memory module), 184-pin DIMM, etc. \n RAM is also classified based upon memory chip type. In the past, systems used different types of chips based on their manufacturer, but current systems use mostly the same type, usually DDR (dual data rate), DDR2, or DDR3. Although the DDR is the most common type, some unique systems may use RDRAM (Rambus dynamic random access memory). \n Another RAM classification is based on speed. Older memory was classified in nanoseconds (for example, 60 nanoseconds). Over time, all memory became nearly the same speed, as measured in nanoseconds, so they changed this to bus speed (for example, PC-133 memory operates at a bus speed of 133 MHz). Most contemporary memory is now measured in throughput (PC2-6400, which operates at 800 MHz but has 6.4 GBps of bandwidth). \n Finally, memory can be purchased with and classified by parity, non-parity, or ECC. Parity memory checks for errors as data is read/written to the chip. While parity memory can detect an error, it cannot correct it. Non-parity memory, one of the most common types found in desktop computers, has no error checking ability. Error correcting code (ECC) is an advanced version of parity that can find an error and correct that error as it is read/written from the chip. Due to these additional functions, ECC tends to be slower than equivalent non-parity RAM. \n RAM有多種分類：內存模塊類型，芯片類型，速度和奇偶校驗。內存模塊因類型而異，具體取決於母板和母板的外形尺寸。內存模塊由其上的針腳數量定義，例如240針DIMM（雙列直插式內存模塊），184針DIMM等。 RAM也根據存儲芯片類型進行分類。過去，系統根據製造商使用不同類型的芯片，但是當前的系統大多使用相同類型的芯片，通常是DDR（雙數據速率），DDR2或DDR3。儘管DDR是最常見的類型，但某些獨特的系統可能會使用RDRAM（Rambus動態隨機存取存儲器）。 另一個RAM分類基於速度。較舊的內存以納秒（例如60納秒）分類。隨著時間的流逝，所有內存的速度幾乎相同，以納秒為單位，因此他們將其更改為總線速度（例如，PC-133內存以133 MHz的總線速度運行）。現在，大多數當代內存都是按吞吐量衡量的（PC2-6400，工作於800 MHz，但具有6.4 GBps的帶寬）。 最後，可以使用奇偶校驗，非奇偶校驗或ECC購買內存並按其分類。奇偶校驗存儲器在將數據讀/寫到芯片時檢查錯誤。儘管奇偶校驗內存可以檢測到錯誤，但無法糾正錯誤。非奇偶校驗內存是台式計算機中最常見的類型之一，沒有錯誤檢查功能。糾錯碼（ECC）是奇偶校驗的高級版本，可以發現錯誤並在從芯片讀取/寫入該錯誤時糾正該錯誤。由於這些附加功能，ECC往往比等效的非奇偶校驗RAM慢。 \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Classifying Memory.html'}, {'title': 'Determining Type of Memory Based on Motherboard', 'text': 'The type of memory that you need to use is determined by the motherboard. The best practice is to check the motherboard’s manual for the proper type, size, and speed of memory before purchasing new modules. Some motherboards will allow you to mix the sizes of the modules, while others require all modules to be the same size. For example, if there are two memory slots on a motherboard, it may allow you to put a 1 GB module in one slot, and a 2 GB module in another. Other motherboards require all slots to have the same size chips in them, such as 1 GB modules in both slots. Another factor to consider is the “bank” size of the motherboard. Some motherboards support a bank of one, meaning you can use a single module in the motherboard. Other motherboards require two modules to complete a bank (the slots must be filled in pairs). \n Another feature that your motherboard may support is called dual-channel or triple-channel. In these channel modes, the motherboard requires that the user install identical size and speed modules in two (dual) or three (triple) slots. This allows for the interleaving of memory access for faster performance times of the memory, speeding up the computer’s operations. Think about interleaving as if you had two horses pulling a cart instead of one. While each horse may be able to pull 100 pounds on its own, together they can pull 250 pounds. Interleaving in the context of memory is the same idea—speed of access increases when memory is interleaved. The sum total of both memory chips can be accessed faster together than either could individually. \n Finally, the total number of modules that can be installed is also determined by the motherboard’s form factor. If you have a smaller form factor motherboard, such as mini-ATX, it may have fewer slots for modules (maybe two slots versus four or six on a full ATX board). \n 您需要使用的內存類型由主板決定。最佳做法是在購買新模塊之前，先檢查主板手冊中的內存類型，大小和速度是否正確。某些主板可讓您混合使用模塊的大小，而另一些則要求所有模塊的大小均相同。例如，如果母板上有兩個內存插槽，則可能允許您在一個插槽中放置一個1 GB的模塊，在另一個插槽中放置一個2 GB的模塊。其他主板要求所有插槽中都具有相同大小的芯片，例如兩個插槽中都有1 GB的模塊。要考慮的另一個因素是主板的“庫”大小。一些主板支持一組，這意味著您可以在主板中使用單個模塊。其他主板需要兩個模塊來完成存儲（插槽必須成對填充）。 主板可能支持的另一個功能稱為雙通道或三通道。在這些通道模式下，母板要求用戶在兩個（雙）或三個（三重）插槽中安裝相同尺寸和速度的模塊。這樣可以交錯訪問內存，以加快內存的性能，從而加快計算機的運行速度。考慮一下交錯，就好像您有兩匹馬拉著一輛馬車而不是一輛。雖然每匹馬可能自己可以拉100磅，但它們合起來可以拉250磅。在內存上下文中進行交織是相同的想法—交織內存時訪問速度會提高。一起訪問兩個內存芯片的總和比單獨訪問一個芯片更快。 最後，可安裝的模塊總數也由主板的外形尺寸決定。如果您使用的是較小型的主板（例如mini-ATX），則其模塊插槽可能更少（也許是兩個插槽，而完整的ATX板上則是四個或六個）。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Determining Type of Memory Based on Motherboard.html'}, {'title': 'History of RAM', 'text': 'Different types of RAM have been in common use during different time periods. It is important to understand them all, because many companies use a mix of legacy systems and more current ones. DRAM, or dynamic RAM, is one of the oldest types. It requires frequent refreshing of contents. DRAM stores each bit of data or program code in a storage cell consisting of a capacitor and a transistor, and is typically organized in a rectangular configuration of storage cells. A DRAM storage cell is dynamic in that it needs to be refreshed or given a new electronic charge every few milliseconds to compensate for charge leaks from the capacitor. \n SRAM, or static RAM, solved the issue of the need for constant refreshing, but it is quite expensive to manufacture. Therefore, SRAM is only used for very high-speed needs, such as level 1, level 2, and level 3 CPU caches, hard drive buffers, and LCD screen buffers. \n SDRAM, or synchronous DRAM, was the first memory that operated at the same speed as the motherboard’s bus. The initial chips were 168-pin dual in-line memory modules, which have their speed rated in MHz. Common naming conventions include PC-66 (which is equivalent to 66 Mhz), or PC-133, or PC-266. \n While SDRAM performs at the same speed as the motherboard’s bus, the CPU operates many times faster than the motherboard’s bus. DDR SDRAM stands for double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory. This type of memory can transfer data two times per clock cycle, thereby doubling the speed over traditional SDRAM. These chips come in 184-pin varieties, rated in MBps (throughput). A good example of this is something like PC-1600, which is 1600 MBps throughput. \n DDR2 SDRAM is double double data rate SDRAM, which has a higher \xa0 latency \xa0 but faster access to the external bus. These chips have 240 pins to connect their modules to the slot, and are also rated in MBps, such as PC2-4200, which is 4200 MBps (or 4.2 GBps). \n DDR3 SDRAM is known as double data rate 3 SDRAM, and is the latest generation of SDRAM in use today. It runs at a lower voltage and is faster than DDR2, but again the latency is increased over the previous DDR2 modules. These modules also have 240 pins, but they are “keyed” differently than DDR2. The “keyed” portion is where the gap in the pins is located, so only a DDR2 will fit in a DDR2 slot, and a DDR3 will fit only in a DDR3 slot. The common notation for these is PC3-10600, where the 10600 is the speed in MBps. \n Rambus direct ram (RDRAM) is also known as RIMM (Rambus in-line memory module). These modules come in a 184-pin variant (16-bit version) and a 232-pin variant (32-bit version). Each empty slot in the motherboard has to have a continuity module (CRIMM) placed inside it, or the motherboard won’t recognize the memory properly. This is not used in recent systems, but was used heavily in Pentium 4 systems. The RDRAM is measured in MBps, such as RIMM 4200 (or 4200 MBps). \n 在不同時間段內，通常使用不同類型的RAM。了解所有這些信息非常重要，因為許多公司使用的都是舊系統和最新系統。 DRAM或動態RAM是最古老的類型之一。它需要經常刷新內容。 DRAM將數據或程序代碼的每一位存儲在由電容器和晶體管組成的存儲單元中，並且通常以矩形配置的存儲單元來組織。 DRAM存儲單元是動態的，因為它需要每幾毫秒刷新一次或給其提供新的電荷，以補償電容器的電荷洩漏。 SRAM或靜態RAM解決了持續刷新的問題，但製造成本很高。因此，SRAM僅用於非常高速的需求，例如1級，2級和3級CPU高速緩存，硬盤驅動器緩衝區和LCD屏幕緩衝區。 SDRAM或同步DRAM是第一個以與主板總線相同的速度運行的內存。最初的芯片是168針雙列直插式內存模塊，其速度額定為MHz。常見的命名約定包括PC-66（相當於66 Mhz），PC-133或PC-266。 儘管SDRAM的性能與主板總線相同，但CPU的運行速度比主板總線快許多倍。 DDR SDRAM代表雙倍數據速率同步動態隨機存取存儲器。這種類型的存儲器可以在每個時鐘週期兩次傳輸數據，從而使速度比傳統SDRAM快一倍。這些芯片有184引腳的型號，額定為MBps（吞吐量）。一個很好的例子就是PC-1600，吞吐量為1600 MBps。 DDR2 SDRAM是雙倍數據速率SDRAM，具有更高的延遲，但對外部總線的訪問速度更快。這些芯片具有240個引腳以將其模塊連接到插槽，並且還以MBps額定，例如PC2-4200，即4200 MBps（或4.2 GBps）。 DDR3 SDRAM被稱為雙倍數據速率3 SDRAM，是當今使用的最新一代SDRAM。它在較低的電壓下運行，並且比DDR2更快，但是與之前的DDR2模塊相比，延遲又增加了。這些模塊還具有240針，但是它們的“鍵控”與DDR2不同。 “鍵控”部分是引腳之間的間隙所在的位置，因此只有DDR2可以插入DDR2插槽，而DDR3只能插入DDR3插槽。這些的常用符號是PC3-10600，其中10600是MBps的速度。 Rambus直接RAM（RDRAM）也被稱為RIMM（Rambus嵌入式存儲模塊）。這些模塊具有184針變體（16位版本）和232針變體（32位版本）。主板上的每個空插槽都必須在其中放置一個連續性模塊（CRIMM），否則主板將無法正確識別內存。在最近的系統中未使用此功能，但在Pentium 4系統中大量使用了此功能。 RDRAM以MBps為單位進行測量，例如RIMM 4200（或4200 MBps）。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'History of RAM.html'}, {'title': 'Parity', 'text': 'Memory Module Width \n Memory module width is measured by the number of bits that can be transferred. Memory began in 8-bit varieties, but has increased to 16 bits, 32 bits, and now 64 bits in current systems. Memory must be added in banks to ensure the width equals the width of the memory bus. For example, if you need 64 bits and a single module offers 64 bits, then it will have one module in the bank. Dual-channel memory requires double the amount, therefore two 64-bit (128 bit) DIMMs are needed in the banks, while three are required for triple-channel, as was mentioned earlier. \n 內存模塊的寬度由可傳輸的位數決定。內存最初以8位形式出現，但在當前系統中已增加到16位，32位和現在的64位。必須以存儲體的形式添加內存，以確保其寬度等於內存總線的寬度。例如，如果您需要64位，而單個模塊提供64位，則庫中將只有一個模塊。如前所述，雙通道內存需要兩倍的存儲量，因此存儲庫中需要兩個64位（128位）DIMM，而三通道則需要三個。 \n \n Parity and ECC \n Parity is used to perform basic error checking and to ensure the memory contents are reliable. This memory is slower than non-parity, but adds the reliability needed for servers and certain desktop workstations. \n Parity checking is a rather simple method of detecting memory errors, without any correction capabilities. Parity is signified in a single bit of data that is added to the transmitted data string. If the module normally would have seven bits of data, an eighth is added as the parity bit. If the module normally would have eight chips for data, a ninth chip is added for parity. \n Every byte has a parity bit associated with it. In the case that seven bits make up the original data, there are eight total bits transmitted (seven original data bits plus one parity bit). In the case that eight bits make up the original data, a total of nine bits are transmitted (eight data bits plus one parity bit). The parity bit is set at write time, and then calculated and compared at read time to determine if any of the bits have changed since the data was stored. This type of checking is limited to detection of single bit errors. If two bits have been altered, the parity check will “pass,” and the error is allowed to possibly corrupt the data. \n Parity checking can be implemented either as “0” parity or “1” parity. When the byte is stored, the number of zeros (or ones, if “1” parity is selected) is added up. The result is stored in the parity bit – “1” if odd, “0” if even. When that byte is read from memory, the bits are again counted and the result is compared against what was stored in the parity bit. A match means that the data was not changed from when it was stored (or that two bits were altered in such a way that the result is the same). \n The process to determine the parity bit is the same, regardless of the number of original data bits transmitted. Typically, there are either seven or eight bits of original data. \n The parity bit is determined by counting the number of “1” bits in a data string. \n 奇偶校驗用於執行基本的錯誤檢查並確保內存內容可靠。此內存比非奇偶校驗慢，但增加了服務器和某些台式機工作站所需的可靠性。 奇偶校驗是一種檢測內存錯誤的相當簡單的方法，沒有任何校正功能。奇偶校驗在添加到傳輸數據字符串的單個數據位中表示。如果模塊通常具有七個數據位，則將八分之一添加為奇偶校驗位。如果模塊通常有八個芯片用於數據，則添加第九個芯片以實現奇偶校驗。 每個字節都有一個與之關聯的奇偶校驗位。在七位組成原始數據的情況下，總共傳輸了八位（七位原始數據位加一個奇偶校驗位）。在八位組成原始數據的情況下，總共傳輸九位（八位數據位加一位奇偶校驗位）。奇偶校驗位在寫入時設置，然後在讀取時進行計算和比較，以確定自存儲數據以來是否有任何位發生了更改。這種類型的檢查僅限於檢測單個位錯誤。如果更改了兩位，則奇偶校驗將“通過”，並且允許該錯誤可能破壞數據。 奇偶校驗可以實現為“ 0”奇偶校驗或“ 1”奇偶校驗。存儲字節時，將加零（如果選擇了“ 1”奇偶校驗，則為零）的數目。結果存儲在奇偶校驗位中-如果為奇數，則為“ 1”；如果為偶數，則為“ 0”。當從內存中讀取該字節時，將再次對這些位進行計數，並將結果與奇偶校驗位中存儲的結果進行比較。匹配表示數據從存儲時起就沒有改變（或以結果相同的方式更改了兩位）。 不管發送的原始數據位數是多少，確定奇偶校驗位的過程都是相同的。通常，原始數據有七位或八位。 奇偶校驗位是通過對數據字符串中“ 1”位的數量進行計數來確定的。 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Parity.html'}, {'title': 'Installing Memory Modules', 'text': 'Installing memory is a common computer upgrade and a very easy task to perform.

Notice that while the information available is consistent between the two, the interface is slightly different. \n BIOS界面和用於進入BIOS的擊鍵取決於BIOS製造商。下面是來自兩個不同製造商的BIOS接口的圖像。請注意，儘管兩者之間的可用信息是一致的，但界面略有不同。 \n \n Phoenix Award BIOS \n \n Dell BIOS \n \n \n Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) \n \n Traditionally, there was only a single type of BIOS, which relied fully on text-based menus and the keyboard for input. More recently, most BIOS manufacturers have switched to the unified extensible firmware interface, or\xa0 UEFI . This updated BIOS allows for both keyboard and mouse input, and provides a \xa0 GUI \xa0 instead of the standard text-based menus; support for GUID partition tables ( GPT ) allowing access to disks up to 2 TB and backward compatibility to legacy partition structures (such as the master boot record ( MBR ) and Linux's GRand Unified Bootloader ( GRUB ); boot from removable media; a user interface allowing for online connectivity for web access, diagnostics, and file management; and \xa0 Secure Boot \xa0 which protects pre-operating system code from modification. Some of these UEFI BIOS also include software that allows the user to surf the Internet, play basic games, and use backup programs without ever entering the normal operating system. \n \n 傳統上，只有一種類型的BIOS，它完全依賴於基於文本的菜單和用於輸入的鍵盤。最近，大多數BIOS製造商已切換到統一的可擴展固件接口或UEFI。此更新的BIOS允許鍵盤和鼠標輸入，並提供GUI而不是標準的基於文本的菜單。支持GUID分區表（GPT），允許訪問最大2 TB的磁盤，並向後兼容舊分區結構（例如主啟動記錄（MBR）和Linux的GRand Unified Bootloader（GRUB）；從可移動媒體啟動；用戶界面）允許在線連接以進行Web訪問，診斷和文件管理；以及安全啟動（Secure Boot），可防止操作系統前代碼被修改；其中某些UEFI BIOS還包括允許用戶上網，玩基本遊戲和使用的軟件。無需進入正常操作系統即可備份程序。 \n \n Automatic Configuring of BIOS/CMOS \n Automatic configuration is a feature of some BIOS. While automatic BIOS configuration does not always create the most optimal settings, it can be quite useful if major errors are occurring to create a safe rollback to a known good state. Automatic configuration options include the BIOS defaults (original/failsafe settings) and setup defaults (optimal settings). There is often a turbo setup, which works toward a quick configuration for a faster system. Automatic configuration of the BIOS is often useful while troubleshooting a system. \n 自動配置是某些BIOS的功能。儘管自動BIOS配置並非總能創建最佳設置，但是如果發生重大錯誤以將安全回滾創建到已知的良好狀態，它可能會非常有用。自動配置選項包括BIOS默認設置（原始/故障安全設置）和設置默認設置（最佳設置）。通常有一個turbo設置，可以快速配置以實現更快的系統。在對系統進行故障排除時，BIOS的自動配置通常很有用。 \n \n Configuration of BIOS settings.

We will focus on the installation of a video card. It is important to note that the same principles for installing a video card will apply to installing any expansion card. Next, we will cover the central processing units from two major manufacturers: Intel and AMD. Finally, we will review the storage devices that our computers can use. \n 在本課程中，我們將更深入地研究可插入主板的擴展卡。我們將重點介紹視頻卡的安裝。重要的是要注意，安裝視頻卡的相同原理將適用於安裝任何擴展卡。接下來，我們將介紹兩個主要製造商的中央處理單元：英特爾和AMD。最後，我們將回顧計算機可以使用的存儲設備。 \n Expansion Slots \n Expansion cards are used to increase and expand a computer’s capability. We can add cards that perform a variety of functions, such as adding more USB, serial, or parallel ports. Communication-based cards can also expand the feature set of the computer through adding a modem or network card. Users who want to play more games may find it useful to add a new video card with better graphics capabilities. Users trying to conserve space could add a TV tuner expansion card to allow the computer to act like a TV to watch cable and record shows like a DVR. Most commonly, though, expansion slots are used to add new ports and features that were not originally available when the computer was made, such as eSATA, FireWire, or USB 3.0 ports. \n 擴充卡用於增強和擴展計算機的功能。我們可以添加執行各種功能的卡，例如添加更多USB，串行或併行端口。基於通信的卡還可以通過添加調製解調器或網卡來擴展計算機的功能集。想要玩更多遊戲的用戶可能會發現添加具有更好圖形功能的新視頻卡很有用。試圖節省空間的用戶可以添加電視調諧器擴展卡，以使計算機像電視一樣觀看電纜，並像DVR一樣錄製節目。但是，最常見的是，擴展槽用於添加新端口和新功能，例如在創建計算機時最初不可用的端口和功能，例如eSATA，FireWire或USB 3.0端口。 \n \n PCI/PCI-X Slots \n An expansion slot is a receptacle on the motherboard for expansion cards. The first expansion slot we will discuss is the oldest covered by the CompTIA A+ hardware exam: the peripheral component interconnect (PCI). PCI was originally developed in the early 1990s to provide an expansion slot for network, video, audio, I/O (input/output), modem, and storage host adapter cards. It replaced older technology, such as the industry standard architecture (ISA) card, as a faster and more robust expansion card slot. It was found as a 32-bit interface supporting a maximum \xa0 bus speed \xa0 of 33 MHz. Later, it also offered a 64-bit variety at a speed of 66 MHz, but even this was not fast enough for the growing demand of faster CPUs. Along came the upgrade, called PCI-X, which is a faster, 64-bit version running at a bus speed of 133 MHz. This PCI-X, which is found on modern computers that still have a PCI/PCI-X slot, is fully backward compatible with older PCI cards, but if you mix them with newer PCI-X cards, the motherboard defaults back to the slower PCI speeds. The latest version, PCI-X 2.0 supports speeds of up to 266 MHz to 533 MHz, but has been replaced by the PCIe (PCI express) card slot standards for better speed/performance. \n PCI supports a 32- or 64-bit I/O bus providing compatibility with both 486 and Pentium machines. Here are some facts about this slot: \n \n This bus is processor independent (the CPU and the PCI bus can process concurrently). \n PCI is plug-and-play, meaning that newly installed devices can be detected and configured automatically. \n PCI buses are most commonly used for devices such as sound cards, modems, network cards, and storage device controllers. \n The PCI bus is usually 32 bits wide, although 64-bit versions have been used as well. Running at 33 MHz, it can transfer data at 133 MBps (or 266 MBps for 64-bit versions). \n \n PCI is an I/O bus that supports both 32- and 64-bit data paths and has been a standard expansion bus since the Intel 80486 (1989) chipset through all versions of Pentium, Apple Computers, and AMD chipsets. While PCI is definitely a legacy architecture, being replaced by PCIe and Thunderbolt interfaces, it is still included on current mainboards and definitely found in service in most computer workstations. \n 擴展插槽是主板上用於擴展卡的插槽。我們將討論的第一個擴展插槽是CompTIA A +硬件考試涵蓋的最早的插槽：外圍組件互連（PCI）。 PCI最初是在1990年代初開發的，旨在為網絡，視頻，音頻，I / O（輸入/輸出），調製解調器和存儲主機適配器卡提供擴展插槽。它取代了較早的技術，例如行業標準體系結構（ISA）卡，以提供更快，更強大的擴展卡插槽。發現它是支持最大總線速度為33 MHz的32位接口。後來，它還以66 MHz的速度提供了64位版本，但是即使這樣也不夠快，無法滿足對更快CPU的不斷增長的需求。隨之而來的升級稱為PCI-X，它是一種更快的64位版本，以133 MHz的總線速度運行。該PCI-X在仍然具有PCI / PCI-X插槽的現代計算機中可以找到，它與舊的PCI卡完全向後兼容，但是如果將它們與更新的PCI-X卡混合使用，則主板默認設置為較慢PCI速度。最新版本的PCI-X 2.0支持最高266 MHz至533 MHz的速度，但已被PCIe（PCI Express）卡插槽標準所取代，以實現更好的速度/性能。 \n PCI支持32位或64位I / O總線，從而與486和Pentium計算機兼容。以下是有關此廣告位的一些事實： \n 該總線獨立於處理器（CPU和PCI總線可以同時處理）。PCI是即插即用的，這意味著可以自動檢測和配置新安裝的設備。PCI總線最常用於聲卡，調製解調器，網卡和存儲設備控制器等設備。儘管也使用了64位版本，但PCI總線通常為32位寬。它以33 MHz的速度運行，可以133 Mbps的速率傳輸數據（對於64位版本，則為266 Mbps的速率）。PCI是支持32位和64位數據路徑的I / O總線，並且自Intel 80486（1989）芯片組通過所有版本的Pentium，Apple Computers和AMD芯片組以來，一直是標準的擴展總線。儘管PCI絕對是一種傳統體系結構，已被PCIe和Thunderbolt接口取代，但它仍包含在當前主板上，並且可以在大多數計算機工作站的服務中找到。 \n Summary \n \n The PCI bus runs independently of the System bus, which allows faster access times for peripheral devices using the expansion card. \n PCI is PnP in both the BIOS and modern Operating Systems (WinXP +, Linux, and Apple). \n Common PCI bus expansion cards include sound cards, USB cards, Firewire cards, network cards, storage device controller (SCSI) cards, and modem cards. \n PCI versions originally used 32-bit and eventually 64-bit data paths with the following speeds: \n 133\xa0MB/s (32-bit at 33\xa0MHz\xa0– the standard configuration) \n 266\xa0MB/s (32-bit at 66\xa0MHz or 64-bit at 33\xa0MHz) \n 533\xa0MB/s (64-bit at 66\xa0MHz) \n \n \n PCI總線獨立於系統總線運行，從而可以使用擴展卡更快地訪問外圍設備。 \n \n PCI是BIOS和現代操作系統（WinXP +，Linux和Apple）中的PnP。 \n \n 常見的PCI總線擴展卡包括聲卡，USB卡，Firewire卡，網絡卡，存儲設備控制器（SCSI）卡和調製解調器卡。 \n \n PCI版本最初使用32位數據路徑，最終使用64位數據路徑，速度如下： \n \n 133 MB / s（32位，33 MHz –標準配置） \n \n 266 MB / s（66 MHz時為32位或33 MHz時為64位） \n \n 533 MB / s（66 MHz時為64位） \n \n Source: \xa0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Expansion card.

In 1996, the advanced graphics port (AGP) was announced and was embraced by 3D gamers for their high-speed video needs. It originally was introduced as a 1x variety, but as faster speeds were needed other varieties were added, including 2x, 4x, and 8x AGP. Each variety uses a different amount of power, as shown in the table below. \n 由於PCI對於1990年代後期推出的最新3D遊戲而言太慢了，因此需要專門用於圖形的新標準端口。 1996年，高級圖形端口（AGP）正式發布，並因其對高速視頻的需求而受到3D遊戲玩家的歡迎。它最初以1x品種引入，但由於需要更快的速度，因此添加了其他品種，包括2x，4x和8x AGP。每個品種使用不同的電量，如下表所示。 \n \n \n AGP card.

Several different versions of AGP have been implemented over the years: \n \n AGP 1.0 1x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 266 MBps. \n AGP 1.0 2x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 533 MBps. \n AGP 2.0 4x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 1066 MBps. \n AGP 3.0 8x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 2133 MBps. \n \n AGP在很長一段時間內一直處於主導地位，但是PCIe（PCI Express）的引入最終導致了流行度的大幅下降，因為PCIe的速度能夠超過AGP並為所有設備提供單一的插槽類型。\n\n提供AGP支持的主板有一個AGP插槽。這些年來，已經實現了AGP的幾種不同版本： \n \n AGP 1.0 1x：以66 MHz運行，數據吞吐率為266 MBps。  \n AGP 1.0 2x：以66 MHz運行，數據吞吐率為533 MBps。 \n AGP 2.0 4x：以66 MHz運行，數據吞吐率為1066 MBps。 \n AGP 3.0 8x：以66 MHz運行，數據吞吐率為2133 MBps。 \n \n \n Motherboard with AGP slot identified inside the red rectangle.

Five slot sizes are available for PCIe: x1, x2, x4, x8, and x16. While x8 is an official standard, it is not very common and hard to find on both motherboards and cards. The two most common PCIe cards are the x1 and x16. PCIe x1 was designed to replace the old PCI cards for networking, modems, audio, input/output, and other needs by connecting to the southbridge. PCIe x16, on the other hand, focused on replacing AGP and PCI-X for high-speed graphics cards, and connects to the northbridge. Most motherboards support numerous types of PCIe, with several x1 and either one or two x16 card slots available. Notably, a smaller PCIe card can fit into larger PCIe slots, but not vice versa. For example, a PCIe x2 can fit into a PCIe x8, but a PCIe x8 cannot fit into a PCIe x2. \n PCIe is considered the next generation I/O bus architecture. Rather than a shared bus, each PCIe slot links to a switch that prioritizes and routes data through a point-to-point dedicated connection and provides a serial full-duplex method of transmission. There are different versions of PCIe slots. The maximum number of lanes that can be assigned to the card inserted into the slot is based upon the card’s version. Basic PCIe provides one lane for transmission (x1), at a transfer rate of 250 MBps. It can also provide multiple transmission lanes (x2, x4, x8, x16, x32). Newer versions of PCIe can transfer data at an even higher rate per lane: \n PCIe（PCI Express）到2005年開始取代PCI，PCI-X和AGP。PCIe有五個插槽大小可供選擇：x1，x2，x4，x8和x16。雖然x8是官方標準，但它不是很常見，很難在主板和卡上找到。兩種最常見的PCIe卡是x1和x16。 PCIe x1旨在通過連接到南橋來替代用於網絡，調製解調器，音頻，輸入/輸出和其他需求的舊PCI卡。另一方面，PCIe x16專注於替換高速圖形卡的AGP和PCI-X，並連接到北橋。大多數主板支持多種類型的PCIe，具有多個x1和一個或兩個x16卡插槽。值得注意的是，較小的PCIe卡可以放入較大的PCIe插槽中，反之亦然。例如，PCIe x2可以插入PCIe x8中，但PCIe x8不能插入PCIe x2中。 PCIe被認為是下一代I / O總線體系結構。每個PCIe插槽（而不是共享總線）鏈接到交換機，該交換機通過點對點專用連接對數據進行優先級排序和路由，並提供串行全雙工傳輸方法。 PCIe插槽有不同版本。可以為插入插槽中的卡分配的最大通道數取決於卡的版本。基本PCIe提供一個通道用於傳輸（x1），傳輸速率為250 MBps。它還可以提供多個傳輸通道（x2，x4，x8，x16，x32）。較新版本的PCIe可以在每個通道上以更高的速率傳輸數據： \n \n \n PCIe Version 1: 250 MBps \n PCIe Version 2: 500 MBps \n PCIe Version 3: 1 Gbps \n PCIe Version 4: 2 Gbps \n \n PCIe cards are designated both by size and bandwidth capability. For example, a card may be identified as “single-lane (x1) PCIe with throughput up to 2 Gbps”, which would indicate this card is an x1 size card, and a version 4 card, based on its data transfer rate. Note that “Gbps” refers to “gigabits per second,” the measurement of the rate of data transfer. This should not be confused with a “GB” or “gigabyte,” which refers to the storage capacity of a device. The amount of data lanes in a connection represents the amount of bandwidth between the card and the host: more lanes equals more bandwidth. PCIe x32 cards offer maximum bandwidth, but they are rarely used because of their size. \n \n PCIe版本1：250 MBps PCIe \n 版本2：500 MBps  \n PCIe版本3：1 Gbps PCIe \n 版本4：2 Gbps PCIe卡通過大小和帶寬功能指定。 \n 例如，基於其數據傳輸速率，可以將卡標識為“吞吐量高達2 Gbps的單通道（x1）PCIe”，這將表明該卡是x1大小的卡和版本4的卡。請注意，“ Gbps”是指“千兆位每秒”，它是數據傳輸速率的度量。請勿將其與“ GB”或“ GB”混淆，後者是指設備的存儲容量。連接中的數據通道數量表示卡與主機之間的帶寬量：更多的通道等於更多的帶寬。 PCIe x32卡可提供最大帶寬，但是由於其尺寸而很少使用。 \n \n \n VIA EPIA-M910 mini-ITX board — PCIE-03 riser card.

The 64-bit processors and applications are denoted as x64. You can purchase a CPU from either Intel or AMD and it could be x86 or x64, as both companies make both types. The x64 processors allow for larger file sizes, more memory, and complicated programs to run faster and more efficiently. There are three things that differentiate CPU types: 1) socket type (which CPU will fit in which socket); 2) single or multicore design; and 3) the size of its cache.

LGA uses spring-loaded “lands” that connect with the bottom of the processor and a hinged clamp mechanism to hold the processor onto the motherboard. The heat sink is then snapped into the mounting holes at the four corners of the processor socket. \n 英特爾長期以來一直在生產處理器，其現代處理器均使用陸地柵格陣列（LGA）插槽樣式。 LGA使用彈簧加載的“平台”，該平台與處理器的底部連接，並通過鉸鍊式夾緊機構將處理器固定在主板上。然後將散熱器卡入處理器插槽四個角上的安裝孔。 \n \n LGA775 socket, prior to CPU installation.

You should be familiar with the names of the various Intel families, such as Pentium, Celeron, Core, and Sandy Bridge. If you are asked if a certain processor is Intel or AMD, you need to be able to make this determination by the name of the processor alone. All the Intel processors you are asked about in the A+ exam have something in common: two repeated digits. If you see a family name such as LGA 1156, you know it is Intel because the number “1” is repeated in the array number. LGA 1366 has a double “6.” This holds true for all the processors asked about in the A+ exam. \n 英特爾處理器分為多個處理器家族，例如LGA 775，其中包含奔騰4，奔騰D，賽揚，Core 2 Duo，Core 2 Quad和Core 2 Extreme。您應該熟悉各種Intel系列的名稱，例如Pentium，Celeron，Core和Sandy Bridge。如果詢問您某個處理器是Intel還是AMD，則需要能夠僅通過處理器的名稱來做出此確定。您在A +考試中被詢問的所有英特爾處理器都具有一些共同點：兩個重複的數字。如果看到諸如LGA 1156之類的家族名稱，您就知道它是Intel，因為陣列編號中重複了數字“ 1”。 LGA 1366具有雙“ 6”。對於A +考試中要求的所有處理器，這都是正確的。 \n Common Intel land grid arrays: \n \n LGA 775 – Pentium 4, Pentium D, Celeron, Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad, Core 2 Extreme \n LGA 1366 – Core i7 9xx, Xeon series \n LGA 1156 – Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 (not 9xx) \n LGA 1155 – Sandy Bridge Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 (second-generation) \n \n \n Intel Celeron processor.

Therefore, you can tell it is not an Intel processor and, instead, it is an AMD processor. All the other families you need to know for the exam are listed with letters: AM2, AM2+, AM3, AM3+, and FM1. AMD also uses a different socket style called the pin grid array (PGA). The pins on the back of the CPU connect to the processor socket with a zero insertion force (ZIF) mechanism. The heat sink clips onto mounting lugs on two sides of the processor instead of the four corners used by Intel. All AMD sockets are PGA, except the “F” family. \n 除940系列外，AMD通常在其命名約定中使用字母。注意“ 940”沒有重複的兩位數。因此，您可以說它不是Intel處理器，而是AMD處理器。您需要通過考試知道的所有其他其他家庭都列出了以下字母：AM2，AM2 +，AM3，AM3 +和FM1。 AMD還使用了另一種插槽樣式，稱為引腳網格陣列（PGA）。 CPU背面的引腳通過零插入力（ZIF）機制連接到處理器插槽。散熱器夾在處理器兩側的安裝凸耳上，而不是英特爾使用的四個角。除“ F”系列外，所有AMD插槽均為PGA。 \n \n \n AMD processors. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 Chris Pirillo . \n \n \n Overclocking \n Overclocking is the process of running a processor, component, or bus at speeds higher than normal design specifications allow. This can be configured in the BIOS of the machine, if supported. This is a very dangerous practice, since it leads to system instability that causes crashes and higher error rates. Additionally, overclocking components makes them run hotter, which can damage them and shorten their lifespan. More power is consumed in overclocking, which creates more heat, and requires more cooling. It is not recommended to overclock your machine for most users, and should never be used in production (work) machines. Overclocking is highly popular in the gaming community, and requires specialized cooling systems to be in place, such as liquid cooling. \n 超頻是指以高於正常設計規格允許的速度運行處理器，組件或總線的過程。如果支持，可以在計算機的BIOS中進行配置。這是非常危險的做法，因為它會導致系統不穩定，從而導致崩潰和更高的錯誤率。此外，超頻組件會使它們運行溫度更高，這可能會損壞它們並縮短其使用壽命。超頻會消耗更多的功率，從而產生更多的熱量並需要更多的散熱。不建議大多數用戶對計算機進行超頻，並且切勿在生產（工作）計算機上使用該計算機。超頻在遊戲界非常流行，並且需要使用專門的冷卻系統，例如液體冷卻。 \n \n Choosing a Processor \n So which socket and processor is better: Intel or AMD? It depends on the user. For most users, they are fairly equivalent. But high-end gamers who like to overclock their machines tend to select AMD because it allows for more overclocking than the Intel systems. \n 那麼哪個插座和處理器更好：Intel還是AMD？這取決於用戶。對於大多數用戶來說，它們是相當等效的。但是喜歡對自己的計算機進行超頻的高端遊戲玩家傾向於選擇AMD，因為它比Intel系統支持更多的超頻。 \n \n \n \n CPU Cache \n The CPU is more than just the processor — it also contains cache memory. This is a very small amount of memory that provides the fastest memory available to the CPU. Most CPUs have a level 1 and level 2 cache, but some even have a level 3 cache. Because the processor operates so quickly, we want the most-frequently-used information to end up in the cache to speed up the processing. When the processor needs information, it first checks the location “closest” to it (level 1 cache). If the information is not in the level 1 cache, the CPU then checks level 2, then level 3. If the information is not in either of those cache levels, the CPU then reaches out to the system RAM (the next fastest location), and if the information is not there, the CPU then looks to the hard disk drive (the slowest location). By continually trying to find the information closer and more quickly, the processor operations are sped up. \n CPU不僅僅是處理器-它還包含高速緩存。這是非常少量的內存，可為CPU提供最快的內存。大多數CPU具有1級和2級緩存，但有些甚至具有3級緩存。由於處理器的運行速度如此之快，我們希望將最常用的信息存儲在緩存中以加快處理速度。當處理器需要信息時，它首先檢查“最近”的位置（1級緩存）。如果信息不在1級緩存中，則CPU將檢查2級，然後是3級。如果信息不在這兩個緩存級中的任何一個中，則CPU會到達系統RAM（下一個最快的位置），如果信息不存在，則CPU將查找硬盤驅動器（最慢的位置）。通過不斷嘗試更快更近地查找信息，可以加快處理器的運行速度。 \n System performance is improved through the use of cache memory, by enabling the processor to use recent memory locations (cache) rather than retrieving information from main memory. \n \n 通過使能處理器使用最近的內存位置（緩存），而不是從主內存中檢索信息，可以通過使用緩存來提高系統性能。 \n \n The bottom line when it comes to cache and performance — larger cache results in faster CPU performance. \n 最重要的是緩存和性能-更大的緩存可提高CPU性能。 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Processors.html'}, {'title': 'Video Displays and Video Cards', 'text': 'Earlier, we mentioned the various types of expansion cards; now we are going to focus on video/graphics cards.

These cards are add-on cards that create the images you see on the display/monitor. They can come in a variety of expansion card types to fit into the various expansion slots, such as PCI express (PCIe) that is currently dominant, advanced graphics port (AGP), or the older PCI slots. While many low-end desktops come with an integrated graphics chip in the CPU instead of using a dedicated card, this is not suitable for 3D games or CAD/CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) workstations. Therefore, many users will opt to use an add-on graphics card, like the one displayed below, to improve their gaming performance. \n 在前面，我們提到了各種類型的擴充卡。現在我們將專注於視頻/圖形卡。視頻卡種類繁多，並以多種不同的命名約定出售，例如圖形卡，圖形加速卡或圖形適配器。這些卡是附加卡，可創建您在顯示屏/監視器上看到的圖像。它們可以有多種擴展卡類型以適合各種擴展插槽，例如當前占主導地位的PCI Express（PCIe），高級圖形端口（AGP）或較舊的PCI插槽。儘管許多低端台式機都在CPU中集成了圖形芯片，而不是使用專用卡，但這不適用於3D遊戲或CAD / CAM（計算機輔助製造）工作站。因此，許多用戶將選擇使用附加的圖形卡（如下面顯示的圖形卡）來改善其遊戲性能。 \n \n Video card. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 Nelson Wu . \n \n Video cards contain a very strong processor called a graphics processing unit (GPU) which performs the extensive mathematical calculations involved in rendering the 3D images that most games require. This extensive processing creates a lot of heat. So, properly cooling the graphics card is essential. Many cards, especially lower-powered ones, will use a passive heat sink for quiet operations, or will rely on the case fans to remove the heat. Most modern graphics cards actually use dedicated cooling fans and heat shrouds for better cooling, but they are much noisier due to the fans involved, and often required external power. The image above shows an example of a video card with an enclosed shroud and active cooling fan to draw the heat away from the card. \n 視頻卡包含一個非常強大的處理器，稱為圖形處理單元（GPU），該處理器執行渲染大多數遊戲所需的3D圖像時涉及的大量數學計算。這種廣泛的處理過程會產生大量熱量。因此，正確冷卻圖形卡至關重要。許多卡（尤其是功率較低的卡）將使用無源散熱器來實現安靜運行，或者依靠機箱風扇散熱。實際上，大多數現代圖形卡都使用專用的冷卻風扇和散熱罩來更好地冷卻，但是由於涉及的風扇噪音較大，並且通常需要外部電源，因此它們的噪音要大得多。上圖顯示了一個視頻卡的示例，該視頻卡帶有一個封閉的導流罩和主動冷卻風扇，可將熱量從卡中散出。 \n Installing video cards is very similar to installing any other expansion card. First, you must go into the BIOS and ensure the slot is enabled (AGP or PCIe x16). This may require some configuration changes, such as the AGP speed, turning off the onboard graphics chip, or adjusting the graphics memory size. Next, you will want to power off the machine, remove the power, use proper ESD precautions, and install the new expansion cards into the proper slot. Next, cable the monitor to the card, plug the computer back into the outlet, and turn on the computer. Once the computer boots into the operating system, you will need to install the device drivers to ensure the operating system can provide the best graphics available from your new card. \n 安裝視頻卡與安裝任何其他擴展卡非常相似。首先，您必須進入BIOS並確保已啟用插槽（AGP或PCIe x16）。這可能需要進行一些配置更改，例如AGP速度，關閉板載圖形芯片或調整圖形內存大小。接下來，您將需要關閉機器電源，斷開電源，使用適當的ESD預防措施，然後將新的擴充卡安裝到正確的插槽中。接下來，將顯示器連接到插卡，將計算機重新插入電源插座，然後打開計算機電源。一旦計算機啟動進入操作系統，您將需要安裝設備驅動程序，以確保操作系統可以從新卡中提供最佳圖形。 \n Video Output \n Video output comes in various types of connectors based on the motherboard’s chipset or the graphics card’s chipset. The standard that has been used for the past few decades is the VGA (video graphics adapter), which is a DB-15 style connector. VGA relies on providing a good-quality analog output to a traditional computer monitor. The port for this connector is the blue one on the left in the image below. \n 視頻輸出來自基於主板芯片組或圖形卡芯片組的各種類型的連接器。過去幾十年來一直使用的標準是VGA（視頻圖形適配器），它是一種DB-15樣式的連接器。 VGA依靠向傳統的計算機顯示器提供高質量的模擬輸出。該連接器的端口是下圖左側的藍色端口。 \n \n \n Blue VGA connector, white DVI connector, and black HDMI type A video connector. Photo used under CC-BY license from \xa0 Davis Mosans . \n \n The next connector port, shown in white in the middle of the photo above, is called DVI, or digital video interface. It comes in DVI-D (for digital output only), or DVI-I (for integrated output that can provide digital or analog output) varieties. A DVI-I connector can be used with an adapter to operate with a traditional VGA monitor in analog mode, as well. \n 視頻輸出來自基於主板芯片組或圖形卡芯片組的各種類型的連接器。過去幾十年來一直使用的標準是VGA（視頻圖形適配器），它是一種DB-15樣式的連接器。的計算機顯示器提供精確的模擬輸出。該連接器的端口是下圖頂端的藍色端口。 \n The third connector, shown on the right of the image, is an HDMI, or high-definition multimedia interface, connection. HDMI comes with three standard connector types: type A (standard), C (mini), and D (micro). Although there is a designation for a type B, it has not been adopted by any manufacturers at this time. Version 2.0 supports 4K UHD and HDR-enabled devices. Micro HDMI has been largely adopted by the mobile telephone market and is included on almost all current models. The special thing about HDMI is that it isn’t limited to carrying just video, but instead carries both audio and video over a single HDMI cable. HDMI is fully digital and doesn’t support analog displays. \n \n 圖像右側顯示的第三個連接器是HDMI或高清多媒體接口連接。 HDMI帶有三種標準連接器類型：A型（標準），C型（微型）和D型（微型）。儘管有B型的名稱，但目前尚未被任何製造商採用。 2.0版支持支持4K UHD和HDR的設備。微型HDMI已被移動電話市場廣泛採用，並且幾乎包含在所有當前型號中。 HDMI的特殊之處在於，它不僅限於承載視頻，還可以通過一根HDMI電纜同時傳輸音頻和視頻。 HDMI是全數字的，不支持模擬顯示。 \n \n Another connector is DisplayPort, which has two form factors, as shown in the images below. DisplayPort was designed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). Mini DisplayPort was a standard announced by Apple in 2008 and adopted by VESA in 2009 to be included in version 1.2 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#1.2 ). \n \n 另一個連接器是DisplayPort，它具有兩種尺寸，如下圖所示。 DisplayPort由視頻電子標準協會（VESA）設計。迷你DisplayPort是Apple在2008年發布的標準，在2009年被VESA採納，並包含在1.2版中（https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#1.2）。 \n \n \n This makes it an ideal interface connector for laptops and mobile devices, similar to HDMI mini. It is also similar to HDMI in that it supports both video and audio with resolutions up to 3840x2160, which can support 4K UHD. DisplayPort can be found on IBM-clone (PC) machines and is gaining traction in the marketplace on mobile devices as well. \n \n 這使其成為筆記本電腦和移動設備的理想接口連接器，類似於HDMI mini。它也與HDMI類似，因為它同時支持視頻和音頻，分辨率高達3840x2160，可以支持4K UHD。 DisplayPort可以在IBM克隆（PC）機器上找到，並且在移動設備市場上也越來越受歡迎。 \n \n \n \n \n \n DisplayPort.

Photo used under CC-BY-SA license from \xa0 William Hook . \n \n Component/RGB (red green blue) is another high-definition connector type, but provides its output in analog format and only up to 720p of resolution. This was commonly used by VCR and DVD players, to connect to television sets, but can sometimes be found on older computers as a secondary output connector. Using RCA connectors, component video actually requires three connectors to pass the video signal to the TV, each one with a different colored label of red, green, and blue. Audio signals require separate patch cords. \n Component / RGB（紅色，綠色，藍色）是另一種高清連接器類型，但是以模擬格式提供其輸出，並且分辨率最高僅為720p。 VCR和DVD播放器通常使用它來連接電視機，但是有時可以在較舊的計算機上找到它作為輔助輸出連接器。使用RCA連接器，分量視頻實際上需要三個連接器才能將視頻信號傳遞到電視，每個連接器具有不同顏色的紅色，綠色和藍色標籤。音頻信號需要單獨的跳線。 \n \n \n Component/RGB. Photo used under CC-BY-SA license from \xa0 Wikipedia . \n \n \n S-video is a very old type of connection that was originally used to connect video cameras and VCRs to televisions. They provide a resolution of up to 480p in analog signal only. They are often labeled as “TV out” on older computer systems, and are used only as a secondary display output. \n S-video是一種非常古老的連接類型，最初用於將攝像機和VCR連接到電視。它們僅在模擬信號中提供高達480p的分辨率。在較舊的計算機系統上，它們通常被標記為“ TV out”，並且僅用作輔助顯示輸出。 \n \n S-video connection. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 yum 9 me . \n \n \n Finally, we have the oldest type of video interface, Composite Video. This is by far the lowest quality output of all the types we have discussed. This cable also uses RCA connectors with an output of 480p. This cable combines all the video signals over a single RCA cable, usually labeled as “video,” and the connector itself is yellow. The Composite Video cable operates in analog signal only with the audio signal separate as well. Composite differs from Component in that audio cable are bundled together with the Composite Video (Red, White, Yellow), whereas, Component uses a total of five cables (Red, Green, Blue for video and the standard Red and White for audio). \n 最後，我們擁有最古老的視頻界麵類型，即復合視頻。這是迄今為止我們討論過的所有類型中質量最低的產品。該電纜還使用輸出為480p的RCA連接器。該電纜通過一條RCA電纜（通常標記為“視頻”）合併所有視頻信號，並且連接器本身為黃色。複合視頻電纜僅在模擬信號和音頻信號分開的情況下工作。 Composite與Component的不同之處在於音頻電纜與Composite Video（紅色，白色，黃色）捆綁在一起，而Component總共使用了五根電纜（紅色，綠色，藍色用於視頻，標準紅色和白色用於音頻）。 \n \n Composite video RCA cable connector.

So, storage devices are a critical component. Storage devices hold all of the bits and bytes that make up the data we process, photographs, music, and more. There are many different types of storage devices used with modern computers, including hard drives, optical drives, and external drives. Some computers still have legacy storage devices such as floppy disks. \n 正如我們在上一個模塊中討論的那樣，存儲是一種使計算機成為計算機的功能。因此，存儲設備是關鍵組件。存儲設備保留構成我們處理的數據，照片，音樂等的所有位和字節。現代計算機使用許多不同類型的存儲設備，包括硬盤驅動器，光盤驅動器和外部驅動器。某些計算機仍具有舊式存儲設備，例如軟盤。 \n \n Storage Devices: Optical Drives \n Optical drives refer to any disk drive that uses optical media, such as CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray disks. Each disk has a different storage capacity due to the different wavelength of light the laser uses to read the disk, with shorter wavelengths enabling more data to be stored in the same physical space. CDs use infrared light, which has a long wavelength. DVDs use a red laser light, a light with a medium wavelength. Blu-ray uses a blue laser light, which has the shortest wavelength. A CD can hold 700 MB of data, or 80 minutes of music, a DVD can hold 4.7 GB on a standard disc and 8.4 GB on a dual-layer disc. Blu-ray disks can hold 25 GB on a standard disk and 50 GB on a dual-layer disc. Most contemporary workstations have a DVD writer, but Blu-ray writers are becoming more common. Also, each successive technology is backward compatible with the others, therefore a Blu-ray player can also read DVDs and CDs. However, a CD or DVD player cannot read a Blu-ray. \n 光盤驅動器是指使用光盤，CD或DVD或藍光光盤等任何光學介質的磁盤驅動器。由於激光讀取磁盤所使用的光波長不同，每個磁盤具有不同的存儲容量，而較短的波長使更多數據可以存儲在同一物理空間中。 CD使用的紅外光波長很長。 DVD使用紅色激光，即中等波長的光。藍光使用波長最短的藍色激光。 CD可以容納700 MB的數據或80分鐘的音樂，DVD可以在標準光盤上容納4.7 GB，在雙層光盤上可以容納8.4 GB。藍光磁盤在標準磁盤上可以容納25 GB，在雙層磁盤上可以容納50 GB。大多數當代工作站都有DVD刻錄機，但是藍光刻錄機正變得越來越普遍。同樣，每種連續技術都向後兼容，因此藍光播放器還可以讀取DVD和CD。但是，CD或DVD播放器無法讀取藍光。 \n \n The different devices use different nomenclature for their capabilities. A CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, and BD-ROM (Blu-ray) all indicate that the device is a read-only memory (ROM) device. A device that is recordable only once is identified with an “R.” On a CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R or BD-R, the contents of the disc cannot be changed after writing it the first time. The third category of devices are identified as “RW” devices, and known as write-many, write/rewrite, or erasable. This category includes CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, and the BD-RE disc types. \n 不同的設備為其功能使用不同的命名法。 CD-ROM，DVD-ROM和BD-ROM（藍光）均表示該設備是只讀存儲器（ROM）設備。只能記錄一次的設備用“ R”標識。在CD-R，DVD-R，DVD + R或BD-R上，第一次寫入後無法更改光盤的內容。第三類設備被標識為“ RW”設備，稱為多次寫入，寫入/重寫或可擦除。此類別包括CD-RW，DVD-RW，DVD + RW，DVD-RAM和BD-RE光盤類型。 \n The speed of an optical drive is described using an “X-rating.” The original CD players could read at 1X (one times), or 150 KBps. The 1X speed is the speed at which your audio CD drive plays your favorite song. DVD players operate at 1.385 MBps (so that is the 1X speed for that type of device). Blu-ray players operate at 4.5 MBps. When buying a drive, you will see the rating listed, such as a 52X CD player, which means it operates 52 times as fast as the original 150 KBps, or 7800 KBps, which is 7.8 MBps. The 1X for each device is the equivalent to listening to a music CD, watching a DVD, or watching a Blu-ray movie in a traditional player. \n 光盤驅動器的速度用“ X等級”描述。原始CD播放器的讀取速度為1倍（一次）或150 KBps。 1X速度是音頻CD驅動器播放喜歡的歌曲的速度。 DVD播放器的運行速度為1.385 MBps（因此，該類型設備的速度為1倍）。藍光播放器的運行速度為4.5 MBps。購買驅動器時，您會看到列出的等級，例如52X CD播放器，這意味著它的運行速度是原始150 KBps或7800 KBps（7.8 MBps）的52倍。每個設備的1X等效於在傳統播放器中聆聽音樂CD，觀看DVD或觀看藍光電影。 \n Storage Devices: External Devices \n eSATA is an extension of SATA used for external devices. The port looks identical to a regular SATA port and uses the same cables as a SATA port. Using eSATA can be thought of like using an extension cord. It brings the SATA port to the external portion of the computer's case. If your computer doesn’t have an eSATA port, you can purchase eSATA host adapters that fit in an expansion slot, such as a PCIe x1 or PCIe x4. The speed of eSATA can be 3–6 Gbps, which is very comparable to USB 3.0 speeds of 5 Gbps. \n eSATA是用於外部設備的SATA的擴展。該端口看起來與常規SATA端口相同，並且使用與SATA端口相同的電纜。可以認為使用eSATA就像使用一根延長線。它將SATA端口連接到計算機機箱的外部。如果您的計算機沒有eSATA端口，則可以購買適合擴展插槽的eSATA主機適配器，例如PCIe x1或PCIe x4。 eSATA的速度可以達到3–6 Gbps，與USB 3.0的5 Gbps速度非常可比。 \n \n eSATA port. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 yum 9 me . \n \n \n Another form of storage is the flash memory card. It is a type of memory that retains its contents without electricity and is very durable. These are commonly used in digital media players, cameras, and USB thumb drives. These cards come in an enormous variety with nearly 50 different types created, but only a few have become common. These common cards include SD, MMC, Memory Stick, and XD. Some computers have built-in readers for these cards with memory slots, but if your computer doesn’t, an external multi-slot card reader can be added by USB for about $10. \n 另一種存儲方式是閃存卡。它是一種無需通電即可保留其內容的內存，並且非常耐用。這些通常用於數字媒體播放器，相機和USB拇指驅動器。這些卡種類繁多，創建了將近50種不同的類型，但只有少數幾種很常見。這些普通卡包括SD，MMC，Memory Stick和XD。某些計算機為這些帶有內存插槽的卡內置了讀卡器，但是如果您的計算機沒有，則可以通過USB添加外部多插槽讀卡器，價格約為10美元。 \n \n Flash memory cards. Photo used under CC-BY-ND license from \xa0 Sam-Cat . \n \n \n USB flash drives are commonplace today and have replaced floppy disks as the removable media of choice. They are small in physical size and large in memory capability, with the ability to store 64 GB or more of data on a single “stick.” They are popular and easy to use, since they don’t require a special card reader, because the USB device has one built-in. They are often formatted with the FAT-16, FAT-32, or exFAT file system and are ready to use straight out of the box. Simply plug the device into an available USB port, the operating system recognizes it, and you can begin copying, deleting, and modifying files. \n USB閃存驅動器在當今很普遍，並且已取代軟盤作為首選的可移動介質。它們的物理尺寸很小，內存容量也很大，能夠在單個“棒”上存儲64 GB或更多的數據。它們很受歡迎且易於使用，因為它們不需要特殊的讀卡器，因為USB設備內置了一個。它們通常使用FAT-16，FAT-32或exFAT文件系統進行格式化，並且可以直接使用。只需將設備插入可用的USB端口，操作系統即可識別它，然後您就可以開始復制，刪除和修改文件了。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n USB flash drive. Photo used with permission from \xa0 123 RF . \n \n \n \n \n \n Storage Devices: Legacy Devices \n \n \n \n \n Floppy disks dominated the removable storage arena until the late 1990s, and now they are nearly extinct in most organizations. While some removable USB thumb drives can store 64 GB or more of data, floppy disks usually only stored 1.44 MB of data. That means a single thumb drive can store the information from more than 60,000 floppy disks! Floppy disks used flexible magnetic media surrounded by a rigid plastic case. The most common floppy (shown in the bottom image) was the 3.5” floppy, which was named based on the diameter of the magnetic media inside the plastic case. It used to be commonplace to find a floppy disk drive on every computer, which was connected using a mini-molex or BERG power cable and a 34-pin internal IDE/PATA cable. Contemporary machines typically do not have these drives, as they have fallen out of favor with the public. If you have a need for a floppy drive, one can be purchased for less than $20 that can connect to your computer using your USB port. Windows always reserves the A:\\ and B:\\ drives for the floppy disk drive (FDD), even if your system doesn’t have one. \n 直到1990年代後期，軟盤一直在可移動存儲領域佔據著主導地位，現在在大多數組織中它們幾乎已經滅絕。雖然某些可移動USB拇指驅動器可以存儲64 GB或更多的數據，但是軟盤通常僅存儲1.44 MB的數據。這意味著一個拇指驅動器可以存儲來自60,000多個軟盤的信息！軟盤使用柔性磁性介質，並由剛性塑料盒包圍。最常見的軟盤（如左圖所示）是3.5英寸的軟盤，它是根據塑料盒內部磁性介質的直徑來命名的。過去通常在每台計算機上都找到軟盤驅動器，該軟盤驅動器是使用minimolex或BERG電源電纜以及34針內部IDE / PATA電纜連接的。現代機器通常不具有這些驅動器，因為它們已受到公眾的青睞。如果需要軟盤驅動器，可以用不到20美元的價格購買一個軟盤驅動器，它可以使用USB端口連接到計算機。 Windows始終將A：\\和B：\\驅動器保留為軟盤驅動器（FDD），即使您的系統沒有該驅動器也是如此。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3.5-inch floppy disks. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 Grant Frederiksen . \n \n \n \n The final legacy storage device is the tape drive. Whereas FDDs are completely out of service today, tape drives are still used in some corporate environments. However, cloud computing is a natural solution to replace tape backups in enterprise environments because it not only automates the backup process but sends the data securely offsite. Tape drives were one of the first removable storage devices used to back up system data. Many home users now use external USB hard disks for this purpose, but many enterprise environments still rely on the tape drives, since they can store large amounts of data (up to 3 TB on a single tape), and can have that data easily transferred to a remote facility. Tapes can store data in native (1:1) or compressed (2:1) mode. A tape that can natively store 70 GB, in compressed mode can store 140 GB of data. Most tape drives connect via SCSI ports, but some can be found using IDE/PATA or SATA instead. Also, it is important to remember that if you are using a tape drive system, you must rotate your tapes to prevent them from getting worn out and have a good backup plan. The Tower of Hanoi is a common tape rotation system used by system administrators, and can be helpful in creating your rotational schema. \n 最終的舊式存儲設備是磁帶機。儘管FDD如今已完全停用，但磁帶驅動器仍在某些公司環境中使用。但是，雲計算是替換企業環境中磁帶備份的自然解決方案，因為它不僅可以自動執行備份過程，而且可以安全地將數據發送到異地。磁帶驅動器是最早用於備份系統數據的可移動存儲設備之一。現在，許多家庭用戶為此使用外部USB硬盤，但是許多企業環境仍然依賴於磁帶驅動器，因為它們可以存儲大量數據（單個磁帶上最多3 TB），並且可以輕鬆地傳輸這些數據。到遠程設施。磁帶可以本機（1：1）或壓縮（2：1）模式存儲數據。可以在壓縮模式下本機存儲70 GB的磁帶可以存儲140 GB的數據。大多數磁帶機通過SCSI端口連接，但有些磁帶機可以使用IDE / PATA或SATA找到。另外，請務必記住，如果您使用的是磁帶驅動器系統，則必須旋轉磁帶以防止其磨損並製定良好的備份計劃。河內之塔是系統管理員使用的常見磁帶旋轉系統，可以幫助您創建旋轉模式。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tape drive.

These drives store all the user’s data files, applications, and operating systems. Whether the drive is internal or external, it is built the same way. Most drives are built from one or more double-sided platters of aluminum or glass that is coated with a magnetic surface. In the first hard drives, users were lucky to store a maximum of 5 MB of data, but now storage space of 500 GB to 3 TB is commonplace in most users’ workstations. Storage has certainly evolved into expansive storage capacities at minimal cost, with excellent performance speeds. \n 硬盤驅動器（HDD）是迄今為止個人計算機使用的最重要的存儲設備。這些驅動器存儲所有用戶的數據文件，應用程序和操作系統。無論驅動器是內部驅動器還是外部驅動器，其構建方式均相同。大多數驅動器是由一個或多個塗有磁性表面的鋁或玻璃雙面盤製成的。在第一個硬盤驅動器中，用戶很幸運地存儲了最多5 MB的數據，但是現在在大多數用戶的工作站中，500 GB至3 TB的存儲空間已司空見慣。毫無疑問，存儲已發展為具有最低性能和卓越性能的擴展存儲容量。 \n \n \n Hard disk. Copyright: \xa0 karn 2608/123 RF Stock Photo . \n \n Hard disk dissection. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 Roberto Fantana . \n \n Hard drives are rated on several characteristics beyond the simple measurement of how much storage space they have. Most users will simply pick a drive based on the storage capacity, but the other performance factors can be even more important. If the drive is a SATA device, it can reach data transfer speeds of up to 6 Gbps, but that is dependent on how fast the drive can access the data from the disk. Hard drives have a spin rate, which is measured in rotations per minute (RPM). It is common for hard drives to have a 5400 RPM rate, but more expensive drives have 7200 RPM, 10000 RPM, or even 15000 RPM rates. The faster spin rates are usually found in servers and high-performance gaming systems, but the 7200 RPM drives are becoming more commonplace as prices continue to decline. Hard disks also have an internal buffer or cache. A inexpensive drive may have a buffer of only 8 MB, while a more expensive drive will have 64 MB of buffer. The bigger the buffer, the better the performance, and the faster the data retrieval from the disk. \n 除了簡單地測量硬盤具有多少存儲空間外，還對硬盤進行了多種評估。大多數用戶只會根據存儲容量選擇一個驅動器，但其他性能因素可能更為重要。如果驅動器是SATA設備，則它可以達到高達6 Gbps的數據傳輸速度，但這取決於驅動器可以從磁盤訪問數據的速度。硬盤驅動器具有旋轉速度，該旋轉速度以每分鐘的旋轉數（RPM）度量。硬盤驅動器通常具有5400 RPM的速率，但是更昂貴的驅動器具有7200 RPM，10000 RPM甚至15000 RPM的速率。在服務器和高性能遊戲系統中通常可以找到更快的旋轉速度，但是隨著價格的不斷下降，7200 RPM驅動器變得越來越普遍。硬盤還具有內部緩衝區或緩存。便宜的驅動器可能只有8 MB的緩衝區，而價格更高的驅動器將有64 MB的緩衝區。緩衝區越大，性能越好，並且從磁盤檢索數據的速度越快。 \n The newest technology in the storage arena is the solid state drive (SSD). As with most technology, this was fairly expensive when first introduced into the market, but pricing has leveled off and most PC manufacturers offer an SSD solution on new machines. \n 除了簡單地測量硬盤具有多少存儲空間外，還對硬盤進行了多種評估。大多數用戶只會根據存儲容量選擇一個驅動器，但其他性能因素可能更為重要。如果驅動器是SATA設備，則它可以達到高達6 Gbps的數據傳輸速度，但這取決於驅動器可以從磁盤訪問數據的速度。硬盤驅動器具有旋轉速度，該旋轉速度以每分鐘的旋轉數（RPM）度量。硬盤驅動器通常具有5400 RPM的速率，但是更昂貴的驅動器具有7200 RPM，10000 RPM甚至15000 RPM的速率。在服務器和高性能遊戲系統中通常可以找到更快的旋轉速度，但是隨著價格的不斷下降，7200 RPM驅動器變得越來越普遍。硬盤還具有內部緩衝區或緩存。便宜的驅動器可能只有8 MB的緩衝區，而價格更高的驅動器將有64 MB的緩衝區。緩衝區越大，性能越好，並且從磁盤檢索數據的速度越快。 \n Initially, in an effort to increase performance, some HDD manufacturers created a hybrid drive, combining a small solid state drive with a large traditional hard disk to give the user increased speed without the enormous cost of solid state drives. These devices are faster than a traditional drive, but not nearly as fast as an SSD. \n 最初，為了提高性能，一些HDD製造商創建了一種混合驅動器，將小型固態驅動器與大型傳統硬盤結合在一起，從而為用戶提供了提高的速度，而又沒有固態驅動器的巨額成本。這些設備比傳統驅動器快，但不及SSD快。 \n \n In addition to hybrid drives, Intel developed the mSata interface for mobile computing. The smaller form factor allows high-capacity SSD storage at the same access speeds by connecting to the SATA host controller. \n 除了混合驅動器，英特爾還開發了用於移動計算的mSata接口。較小的外形尺寸，通過連接到SATA主機控制器，可以以相同的訪問速度實現大容量SSD存儲。 \n \n SSD/HDD hybrid + HDD hard drive. Photo used under CC-BY license from \xa0 Yutaka Tsutano . \n \n \n SSDs are intended to replace the traditional hard disk. They are fast and durable, and contain no moving parts. The SSD emulates a traditional hard drive and is often used in netbooks, Ultrabooks, and other lightweight systems, or machines that require fast, quiet performance. Most SSDs come in a 2.5-inch form factor, similar to a laptop hard disk, and use a 2.5-inch to 3.5-inch adapter when being placed in a desktop computer. The SSD can be built using multilevel cell (MLC) to save money, but these tend to be much slower than their more expensive and faster counterpart, the SLC (single level cell). Initially, these drives cost five to ten times as much as an equivalent-capacity traditional hard disk. Market demand and increased production have helped lower the pricing. As of the end of 2015, a 2.5-inch 250 GB SATAIII SSD can be purchased for less than $100, but the same amount of money would purchase a traditional 2 TB HDD. But, they are significantly faster and quieter, since they can access the information directly without having to wait for the hard disk to spin up and find the data on the disk. \n SSD旨在替代傳統硬盤。它們既快速又耐用，並且沒有活動部件。 SSD模仿傳統的硬盤驅動器，通常用於上網本，超極本和其他輕量級系統，或要求快速，安靜性能的機器。大多數SSD的外形尺寸為2.5英寸，類似於筆記本電腦的硬盤，放在台式機中時使用2.5英寸至3.5英寸的適配器。可以使用多層單元（MLC）來構建SSD，以節省資金，但是這些SSD往往比價格更高，速度更快的同類產品SLC（單層單元）慢得多。最初，這些驅動器的成本是同等容量的傳統硬盤的五至十倍。市場需求和產量增加幫助降低了定價。截至2015年底，可以以不到100美元的價格購買2.5英寸250 GB SATAIII SSD，但以同樣的金額購買傳統的2 TB HDD。但是，它們可以更快，更安靜地運行，因為它們可以直接訪問信息，而不必等待硬盤啟動並在磁盤上查找數據。 \n \n \n Solid state drive (SSD).

RAID 0 (RAID zero) uses at least two drives to act as a single drive, using \xa0 striping \xa0 to boost performance. But, if either drive fails, all the data is lost. Therefore, with RAID 0, the user gains speed but does not gain any redundancy. RAID 1 (RAID one) uses at least two drives to act as a single drive, using \xa0 mirroring \xa0 to boost redundancy. Every time the drive is written to by the computer, two copies of the information are written (one to each drive). So, if either drive fails, all the data is still accessible and safe on the other drive. With RAID 1 the user gains redundancy, but does not gain any speed. \n 廉價驅動器冗餘陣列（RAID）將眾多傳統物理硬盤驅動器組合到單個邏輯磁盤中，以提供更快或更冗餘的單個驅動器。 RAID 0（RAID 0）至少使用兩個驅動器作為一個驅動器，並通過條帶化來提高性能。但是，如果任何一個驅動器發生故障，所有數據都會丟失。因此，使用RAID 0，用戶可以提高速度，但不會獲得任何冗餘。 RAID 1（RAID 1）至少使用兩個驅動器作為一個驅動器，並使用鏡像來增強冗餘。每次計算機寫入驅動器時，都會寫入兩份信息副本（每個驅動器一份）。因此，如果任何一個驅動器發生故障，所有數據仍然可以在另一個驅動器上訪問並且安全。使用RAID 1，用戶可以獲得冗餘，但不會獲得任何速度。 \n Since RAID 0 gave us speed with no redundancy, and RAID 1 gave us redundancy with no increase in speed, engineers developed a hybrid of the two called RAID 01 or RAID 10. In RAID 01 or 10, four drives are combined using the striping from RAID 0 with the mirroring from RAID 1 to gain both speed and redundancy. The only problem with this solution is that you lose fifty percent of the storage space (just like we did in RAID 1) to overhead/redundancy. To overcome this, another variant, RAID 5, was established. In RAID 5, at least three drives are required and they operate as a single logical drive. When information is written to the drive, that information is striped across the drives and a parity is also spread across the drives. If a single drive fails, the information can be rebuilt using the existing information and parity information to fill in the missing pieces. Using hot-swappable drives, a bad drive can be removed, a new one inserted, and the RAID rebuilt without any downtime (though a performance loss will occur while the RAID is being rebuilt). \n \n 由於RAID 0為我們提供了無冗餘的速度，而RAID 1為我們提供了無速度的冗餘，因此工程師開發了兩種混合的RAID 01或RAID10。在RAID 01或10中，四個驅動器通過使用具有從RAID 1鏡像的RAID 0，可同時獲得速度和冗餘。該解決方案的唯一問題是，您會損失50％的存儲空間（就像我們在RAID 1中所做的一樣）以增加開銷/冗餘。為了克服這個問題，建立了另一個變體RAID 5。在RAID 5中，至少需要三個驅動器，它們可作為單個邏輯驅動器運行。將信息寫入驅動器時，該信息會在驅動器上分條，並且奇偶校驗也會分佈在驅動器上。如果單個驅動器發生故障，則可以使用現有信息和奇偶校驗信息來重建信息以填充丟失的部分。使用可熱插拔的驅動器，可以卸下損壞的驅動器，插入新的驅動器，並且可以在不造成任何停機的情況下重建RAID（儘管在重建RAID時會造成性能損失）。 \n \n \n Stripe of RAID Mirrors.

Some motherboards support these natively, while others will require the user to purchase an expansion card to perform these functions. If your system doesn’t support hardware RAIDs, Windows does support software RAIDs on all systems, but you will lose the benefits of the RAID for the main operating system using this approach. \n 要創建RAID陣列，工作站必須具有支持硬件RAID的PATA或SATA硬件控制器。一些主板本身支持這些功能，而另一些則需要用戶購買擴展卡才能執行這些功能。如果您的系統不支持硬件RAID，則Windows會在所有系統上都支持軟件RAID，但是使用這種方法，您將失去主操作系統的RAID優勢。 \n Hardware RAIDs require at least two hard disks for RAID 0 or RAID 1, at least three disks for RAID 5, and at least four disks for RAID 10 or RAID 01. To create a software RAID, you can use Windows’ disk management software to create the RAIDs for data drives and other partitions. \n 硬件RAID至少需要兩個硬盤用於RAID 0或RAID 1，至少三個磁盤用於RAID 5，以及至少四個磁盤用於RAID 10或RAID01。要創建軟件RAID，可以使用Windows的磁盤管理軟件來創建RAID。為數據驅動器和其他分區創建RAID。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Storage Devices-Hard Disk Drives.html'}, {'title': 'Storage Devices-Drive Interfaces', 'text': 'Computers require several things to function well: a method to receive data input, a method to process data, a way to output data, and a way to store data. Data storage has evolved over the years, but the most common storage mechanism, the hard disk, has been around for more than 35 years. The only real change has been in physical size (they have gotten smaller), logical size (they can store much more data), speed, and connector types. The most common types of connectors are SATA, PATA/IDE, SCSI, floppy, eSATA, FireWire, USB, and network connections, each of which we will discuss. \n 計算機需要幾件事情才能正常運行：一種接收數據輸入的方法，一種處理數據的方法，一種輸出數據的方法以及一種存儲數據的方法。數據存儲已經發展了多年，但是最常見的存儲機制硬盤已經存在了35年以上。唯一真正的變化是物理大小（變得更小），邏輯大小（它們可以存儲更多數據），速度和連接器類型。連接器最常見的類型是SATA，PATA / IDE，SCSI，軟盤，eSATA，FireWire，USB和網絡連接，我們將分別討論它們。 \n PATA (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment) has been around since the 1980s, but used to be called IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics). This type of connector uses a cable made up of 40 wires or 80 wires (which supported cable select mode). Both types of cables had 40 pins on each end. The newer-style cables were color-coded, so that the blue connector attached to the motherboard, the black connector attached to the primary (or master) device, and the gray connector attached to the secondary (or slave) device. This connector type was used for hard disk drives, CD drives, DVD drives, and some tape backup drives. Each of these devices has a jumper on it that must be set to “master,” “slave,” or “cable select” mode. “Cable select” eliminated the need to manually assign the master or slave. Each cable could support up to two devices, but only one master or slave device could be used on each cable. The BIOS had to be configured properly before using these devices. In spite of improvements to the EIDE interface using Ultra Direct Memory Access (UDMA), Serial ATA (SATA) is not limited to four devices per channel and has much faster access times. \n PATA（並行高級技術附件）自1980年代就出現了，但以前被稱為IDE（集成驅動電子設備）。這種類型的連接器使用由40線或80線組成的電纜（支持電纜選擇模式）。兩種類型的電纜的每端都有40個插針。較新樣式的電纜已進行了顏色編碼，因此藍色連接器連接至主板，黑色連接器連接至主（或主）設備，灰色連接器連接至輔助（或從屬）設備。此連接器類型用於硬盤驅動器，CD驅動器，DVD驅動器和某些磁帶備份驅動器。這些設備中的每一個都有跳線，必須將其設置為“主”，“從”或“電纜選擇”模式。 “電纜選擇”消除了手動分配主機或從機的需要。每條電纜最多可支持兩個設備，但是每條電纜上只能使用一個主設備或從設備。使用這些設備之前，必須正確配置BIOS。儘管使用超直接內存訪問（UDMA）對EIDE接口進行了改進，但串行ATA（SATA）不僅限於每個通道四個設備，而且訪問速度更快。 \n \n \n \n IDE drive.

It is called serial because only a single device can be attached to each cable, and the data is transmitted in serial fashion (one bit at a time). These devices often do not have jumpers, but if they have one, it is used to configure the speed of data transfer or to enable a special feature like \xa0 spread spectrum clocking \xa0 . SATA is a peripheral device and is very fast, allowing for speeds of up to 6 Gbps for the newer version, or 3 Gbps for the older versions. The data cable is shaped like an L, with seven pins for data. The power cable is also L-shaped, but has 15 pins. Internal SATA ports can be converted to an eSATA (external SATA) port simply by using a header to connect the internal port. \n SATA是用於硬盤和光盤驅動器的當前連接方法。之所以稱為串行，是因為每條電纜只能連接一個設備，並且數據以串行方式（一次一位）傳輸。這些設備通常沒有跳線，但如果有跳線，則可用於配置數據傳輸速度或啟用諸如擴頻時鐘等特殊功能。 SATA是外圍設備，速度非常快，新版本的速度高達6 Gbps，而舊版本的速度高達3 Gbps。數據電纜的形狀像L形，有七個用於數據傳輸的引腳。電源線也為L形，但有15針。只需使用接頭連接內部端口，即可將內部SATA端口轉換為eSATA（外部SATA）端口。 \n \n SATA drive.

Each device in the chain is provided with a Device ID number that is configured using a selector switch, DIP (dual inline package) switch, or jumper block. SCSI is an older technology and has largely been replaced by SATA and eSATA. Narrow SCSI could only support speeds of up to 40 MBps, while wide SCSI could support up to 320 MBps. \n SCSI或小型計算機系統接口支持將設備（內部或外部）與七個設備（窄SCSI）或15個設備（寬SCSI）進行菊花鏈連接。鏈中的每個設備都提供了一個設備ID編號，該ID使用選擇器開關，DIP（雙列直插式封裝）開關或跳線塊進行配置。 SCSI是一種較舊的技術，在很大程度上已被SATA和eSATA取代。窄SCSI只能支持高達40 MBps的速度，而寬SCSI可以支持高達320 MBps的速度。 \n \n HP Surestore DAT-drive with two blue SCSI ports on the back.

Hot-swapping is the act of adding or removing a device while the computer is still turned on. In the old days, the user would shut the system down, power the workstation off, then connect the device, and turn the machine back on, otherwise the computer wouldn’t recognize the new device. In the late 1990s, the Windows operating system began to allow hot-swapping of devices, which included USB and FireWire. This allowed the user to simply plug in a device, wait a few seconds, and then begin using it to store or retrieve data. Due to this hot-swapping, it is important that users use the “eject drive safely” feature in Windows before unplugging a device, otherwise \xa0 data loss will occur . SATA/eSATA also support hot-swapping, but only if AHCI (advanced host controller interface) is selected during configuration in the BIOS. If not, the drive will work as if it is an older PATA/IDE device and will not support hot-swapping. \n 最初開發台式機時，它們的設計不允許熱插拔設備。熱交換是在計算機仍打開時添加或刪除設備的操作。在過去，用戶會關閉系統，關閉工作站電源，然後連接設備，然後重新啟動計算機，否則計算機將無法識別新設備。在1990年代後期，Windows操作系統開始允許熱插拔設備，包括USB和FireWire。這使用戶可以簡單地插入設備，等待幾秒鐘，然後開始使用它來存儲或檢索數據。由於這種熱交換，在拔出設備電源之前，用戶必須使用Windows中的“安全彈出驅動器”功能，這一點很重要，否則會導致數據丟失。 SATA / eSATA也支持熱插拔，但前提是在BIOS中配置期間選擇了AHCI（高級主機控制器接口）。否則，驅動器將像舊的PATA / IDE設備一樣工作，並且不支持熱插拔。 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Storage Devices-Hot Swapping.html'}, {'title': 'HW2', 'text': '1 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'HW2.html'}, {'title': 'HW3', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'HW3.html'}, {'title': 'EX10', 'text': 'List Overlap Comprehensions \xa0 \xa0 列表重疊理解\xa0 \xa0 \n \n Exercise 10 (and \xa0 Solution ) 練習10（和 解決方案 ） \n This week’s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see \xa0 Exercise 5 ), except require the solution in a different way. \n 本週的練習將重溫舊的練習（請參閱 練習5 ），只是需要以其他方式解決。 \n Take two lists, say for example these two: \n 拿兩個列表，舉例來說，這兩個： \n \t a   =   [ 1 ,   1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   5 ,   8 ,   13 ,   21 ,   34 ,   55 ,   89 ] \n\t b   =   [ 1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 ,   5 ,   6 ,   7 ,   8 ,   9 ,   10 ,   11 ,   12 ,   13 ] \n and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).

So you can put multiple for loops inside the comprehension. But you can also add more complicated conditionals: \n 在這段代碼的最後， allproducts 將包含list \xa0 [5, 10, 15, 10, 20, 30, 15, 30, 45] 。 因此，您可以在理解中放入多個for循環。 但是您還可以添加更複雜的條件： \n \t x   =   [ 1 ,   2 ,   3 ] \n\t y   =   [ 5 ,   10 ,   15 ] \n\t customlist   =   [ a * b   for   a   in   x   for   b   in   y   if   a * b % 2   !=   0 ] \n Now \xa0 customlist \xa0 contains \xa0 [5, 15, 15, 45] \xa0 because only the odd products are added to the list. \n 現在 customlist 包含， [5, 15, 15, 45] 因為僅將奇數產品添加到列表中。 \n In general, the list comprehension takes the form: \n 通常，列表理解採用以下形式： \n \t [ EXPRESSION   FOR_LOOPS   CONDITIONALS ] \n as shown in the examples above. \n 如以上示例所示。 \n Random numbers, continued隨機數，續 \n Try to use the \xa0 Python random documentation \xa0 to figure out how to generate a random list.

Basically, you need to make a decision based on whether something is TRUE or something is FALSE. \n 在編寫程序時，通常會需要根據其他事物的真實性來做出決策。 基本上，您需要根據某物是TRUE還是FALSE來做出決定。 \n An obvious example is when using conditionals: \n 一個明顯的例子是使用條件句時： \n \n    michele_age   =   22 \n   truth_value   =   michele_age   >   17 \n   if   ( truth_value ): \n     print ( "Michele can see a rated R movie" ) \n \n (We talked about this idea of conditionals in \xa0 a previous post .) \n （我們在上 一篇文章中 討論了這種有條件的想法 。） \n But what is happening behind the scenes is that the statement \xa0 michele_age > 17 \xa0 is being evaluated into a type that is either \xa0 True \xa0 or \xa0 False . This is then getting stored inside the variable \xa0 truth_value , and then the decision is being made inside the conditional. \n 但是幕後發生的事情是該語句 michele_age > 17 正在被評估為 True or或 類型 False 。 然後將其存儲在變量中 truth_value ，然後在條件中進行決策。 \n Here is another example: \n 這是另一個示例： \n \n    while   True : \n     age   =   input ( "How old are you? " ) \n     if   age   >=   17 :  \n       print ( "can see a rated R movie" ) \n     elif   age   <   17   and   age   >   12 : \n       print ( "can see a rated PG-13 movie" ) \n     else :  \n       print ( "can only see rated PG movies" ) \n \n What the \xa0 while True \xa0 statement does at the beginning of the code segment is continue asking for an age and printing a response - it never stops. (To stop it, press CTRL-C in a terminal or in the Python shell). \n 該 while True 語句在代碼段開頭的作用是繼續詢問年齡並打印響應-它永遠不會停止。 （要停止它，請在終端或Python Shell中按CTRL-C）。 \n These types - \xa0 True \xa0 and \xa0 False \xa0 are called \xa0 boolean \xa0 types or \xa0 boolean \xa0 variables. They can only take on two values, either \xa0 True \xa0 or \xa0 False . \n \n For more extensive reading on Python booleans, take a look at \xa0 these \xa0 resources . \n 這些類型的- True 和 False 被稱為 布爾 類型或 布爾 變量。它們只能採用 True 或的兩個值 False 。 \n 要更廣泛地了解Python布爾值，請查看 這些 \xa0 資源 。 \n Equality testing on strings 字符串相等性測試 \n Scenarios come up where you need to test if things are equal to each other - numbers or strings or something else. We covered this idea in \xa0 a previous post , but it is worth returning to again, this time for strings. \n 在場景中，您需要測試事物是否彼此相等-數字或字符串或其他。我們在上 一篇文章中 介紹了這個想法 ，但是這次還是值得再來一次。 \n Good thing it’s easy! \n 好東西很容易！ \n Remember, comparing numbers for equality is done with an \xa0 == \xa0 sign, like so: \n 請記住，比較數字是否相等是用一個 == 符號 完成的 ，如下所示： \n \n    age   =   21 \n   if   age   ==   21 : \n     print ( "You are 21!" ) \n   elif   age   >   21 : \n     print ( "You\'re old." ) \n   else : \n     print ( "Young one!" ) \n \n Turns out, comparing strings is equally (hehe..) simple, using a \xa0 == \xa0 to check for equality and \xa0 != \xa0 to check for inequality. \n 事實證明，使用a == 來檢查相等性和 != 檢查 不相等性，比較字符串同樣（嘿，..）很簡單 。 \n \n    password   =   "unsafepassword" \n   if   password   ==   "unsafepassword" : \n     print ( "You may enter." ) \n   else : \n     print ( "Try again!" ) \n \n Or, a more practical password-checking piece of code: \n 或者，使用更實用的密碼檢查代碼： \n \n    real_password   =   "unsafepassword" \n   user_password   =   input ( "Enter the password: " ) \n   while   user_password   !=   real_password : \n     user_password   =   input ( "Enter the password: " ) \n   print ( "You may enter!" ) \n \n Binary search 二進制搜索 \n There are a number of ways to search for elements in a list, and there is no one correct way to do so. The point of this exercise is to get you thinking about possible ways to search for elements in the list, in an entire sequence of exercises about lists, searching, and sorting. This exercise might seem silly and easy at first, but the more you dive into this topic, the more difficult it becomes. \n 有多種方法可以搜索列表中的元素，但沒有一種正確的方法可以搜索列表中的元素。 該練習的目的是讓您思考有關列表，搜索和排序的整個練習序列中搜索列表中元素的可能方法。 剛開始時，此練習可能看起來很愚蠢且容易，但是您越深入該主題，就越困難。 \n The word “binary” means there are two choices (in computers, often this is 0 or 1, but it really means any choice between two things). “Search” is to look for something. So the main idea behind binary search is to look for something in a way that gives you a decision tree for where to look, containing two choices. Let me give you an example: \n “二進制”一詞表示有兩種選擇（在計算機中，通常是0或1，但實際上表示在兩種情況之間可以選擇）。 “搜索”是尋找東西。 因此，二進制搜索背後的主要思想是以某種方式尋找事物，該決策樹為您提供尋找位置的決策樹，其中包含兩個選擇。 讓我舉一個例子： \n Let’s take the list \xa0 a = [1, 3, 5, 30, 42, 43, 500] . It is an “ordered list”, or a list where the elements in the list go from smaller to larger. Let’s say we want to know whether the element \xa0 9 \xa0 is in the list or not. Here is what we do: \n 讓我們看一下清單 a = [1, 3, 5, 30, 42, 43, 500] 。 它是一個“有序列表”，或者是列表中元素從小到大的列表。 假設我們想知道元素 9 是否在列表中。 這是我們的工作： \n \n Look at the middle element in the list - it is ‘30’. * ‘9 < 30’, so let us ignore the elements to the right of ‘30’. \n 查看列表中的中間元素-它是“ 30”。 *\'9 <30\'，因此讓我們忽略\'30\'右邊的元素。 \n The new list we are looking at is now \xa0 [1, 3, 5] . \n 現在我們正在查看的新列表 [1, 3, 5] \n Look at the middle element in this new list - it is \xa0 3 . \n 看一下這個新列表的中間元素-是 3 。 \n ‘9 > 3’, so ignore the elements to the left of \xa0 3 . \n \'9> 3\'，因此忽略左側的元素 3 。 \n The new list we are looking at is \xa0 [5] . \n 我們正在查看的新列表是 [5] 。 \n The list has one element and it is not \xa0 9 . \n 該列表只有一個元素，而沒有 9 。 \n 9 \xa0 is not in the list. \n 9 \xa0 不在列表中。 \n \n What the example shows is that in an ordered list, knowing how the element you are looking for compares to another element in the list splits the list in two - one half where the element can be, and one where it definitely cannot be. In the case where our list contains millions of elements, knowing that we can cut the “search space” in half is a great increase in efficiency. \n 該示例顯示的是，在有序列表中，知道要查找的元素與列表中另一個元素的比較方式，將列表分為兩部分-元素可以位於其中一半，而絕對不能位於其中。 在我們的列表包含數百萬個元素的情況下，知道我們可以將“搜索空間”減少一半，這將大大提高效率。 \n When you are writing the solution, first try to write it without binary search. Then when you want to try implementing binary search, write a separate function. In the solution I will give an example for how to write a binary search in Python. \n 在編寫解決方案時，請首先嘗試在不進行二進制搜索的情況下編寫它。 然後，當您想嘗試實現二進制搜索時，編寫一個單獨的函數。 在解決方案中，我將給出一個示例，說明如何使用Python編寫二進制搜索。 \n Happy coding! \n 祝您編碼愉快！ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'EX20.html'}]};
